# @majobot/twitch-platform-client
This is a reference implementation of the ```PlatformClient``` interface mentioned in [@majobot/api](https://github.com/majobot/api/) for twitch.tv.

### Usage
It is recommended to use the client in combination with an implementation of the ```Bot``` interface of the API.
However, it is also possible to use the client in a standalone manner.

**NOTE** Further documentation is in the making.
